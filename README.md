Diabetes is one of deadliest diseases in the world. As per the existing system, patients have to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor and wait for a day or more to get their result. Moreover, every time they want to get their diagnosis report, they have to waste their money in vain. But with the rise of Machine Learning approaches, we have been able to find a solution to this problem using data mining. Data mining is one of the key areas of Machine learning. It plays a significant role in diabetes research because it has the ability to extract hidden knowledge from a huge amount of diabetes related data. The aim of this research is to develop a system which can predict whether the patient has diabetes or not. Furthermore, predicting the disease early leads to treatment of the patients before it becomes critical. Currently, the models give accuracy of 79% for Logistic Regression.
